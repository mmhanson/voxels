## Introduction

An experiment in procedural terrain generation, currently in the prototype phase. This project originally
started with my project [Voxography](https://github.com/mmhanson/Voxography), but I got sick of C so I switched to Python.
This project drew on [Fogleman's Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft) for starting code.


## Building

1. Make the virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`

2. Enter the virtual environment `source env/bin/activate`
